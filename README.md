This project visualizes restaurant scores from the Yelp Academic Dataset, using object-oriented programming and introductory machine learning algorithms. 
It was developed as part of a class assignment and presents results using a Voronoi diagram.
Some of the program's main features:
- Use OOP and Data Abstraction technique to encapsulate data and hide lower-implementation details
- Implement basic ML algorithms to cluster restaurants together and predict users' score.
